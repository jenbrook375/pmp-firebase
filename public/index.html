            <h3 class="title">What is UX/UI, and Why Does it Matter?</h3>
            <p id="ux">“UX” stands for “user experience.” A user’s experience of the app is determined by how they
                interact with it. Is the experience smooth and intuitive or clunky and confusing? Does navigating the
                app feel logical or does it feel arbitrary? Does interacting with the app give people the sense that
                they’re efficiently accomplishing the tasks they set out to achieve or does it feel like a struggle?
                User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface
                elements that the UI designers have created...</p>
            <div id="panel">
                <p>The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an
                    application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders,
                    text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen
                    layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual
                    element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.</p>
                <p>To put it simply, UX/UI is important because it tries to fulfill the user’s needs. It aims to provide
                    positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user
                    experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to
                    business success.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Because You Wouldn't Wear a Leisure Suit in Public Either</h3>
            <p>You've spent a lot of time and effort building your firm's reputation. Don't neglect your online reputation by having a dated website. Trends move quickly, and it's important that your online presence changes with the times.</p>
            <p>Can we build a website that makes being a lawyer look Instagram cool? Probably not. But we can build something that looks modern and functions well. <b>And really, isn't that what being cool is all about?</b>
